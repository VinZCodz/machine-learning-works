# Uni Variate Linear Regression:
Let's Get This Prediction Thing Started! Notebook captures my intutions while learning the model and bringing them to implementation.

**Contents:**

- **Data Visualization:** Plots the training data (housing prices vs. size).
- **Model Definition:** Defines the linear model function `f_wb(x) = w*x + b`. It's the crux of our prediction!
- **Cost Function:** Implements the mean squared error cost function `J(w, b)`. This is how we measure how "off" our predictions are â€“ the lower the cost, the better!
- **Gradient Descent:** Implements the gradient descent algorithm to find the *best* values for `w` and `b` that make that cost function hit rock bottom. Think of it as finding the lowest point in a valley!
- **Visualization of Cost and Gradient:** Shows how the cost function varies with `w` and `b`, and the direction of the gradient. It always points us towards the steepest descent!
- **Training and Prediction:** Runs gradient descent to train the model and makes a prediction using the learned parameters.
