# Multi Variate Linear Regression:

**Prerequisites:**

- **Google Colab** You'll need a place to run this code. Click on the "Open in Colab" on the notebook.
- **Helper Files:** Make sure you have all the other files (which are present in the same directory of the notebook). You can upload it to the files section once the notebook is opened. Run the cells in order and check.
- **Experiment!:** Feel free to play around with the code! Change the training data, the initial `w` and `b` values, or the learning rate (`alpha`) to see how it affects the results.
