# Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression is a regression technique that models non-linear relationships between an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y) by fitting a polynomial equation to the data. Unlike linear regression, which assumes a straight-line relationship, polynomial regression captures curved patterns by adding higher-degree terms of the independent variable (like x², x³, etc.) to the model. This allows for more complex and flexible data fitting, representing relationships that cannot be adequately described by a straight line.
